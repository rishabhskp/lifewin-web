<ul>
<li><p><strong> 7.1 </strong> &nbsp;  Free Use of lifewin</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> 7.1.1 </strong> &nbsp;  The agreement on free use of lifewin apps is for an indefinite period.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong> 7.1.2 </strong> &nbsp;  You can terminate the agreement at any time by selecting the &quot;delete your account&quot; option in the account settings, thereby deleting your account. On termination, unsecured data will be lost as we will delete your account completely. We will inform you of this again separately before we delete your account.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong> 7.1.3 </strong> &nbsp;  We can terminate this agreement in writing with a notice period of two (2) weeks (email will be sufficient).</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong> 7.2 </strong> &nbsp;  Use of PRO Accounts</p>

</li>

</li>
<li><p><strong> 7.2.3 </strong> &nbsp;  Agreements with a minimum term will run until the end of the agreed period and will be extended automatically by the same period if you do not terminate your Account beforehand by deleting it in accordance with No. 7.1.2 or by downgrading it to free use.

Reimbursement of already-paid fees for the current term is not possible.</p>
</li>

If use is partially available, the charges will be reduced to an appropriate level for the period until the defect is corrected.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong> 8.3 </strong> &nbsp;  You must inform us of the defect in writing or by email immediately.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong> 9.2.1 </strong> &nbsp;  Claims by users for compensation will not be recognized. Exceptions are: damages claimed by users for death, physical injury, harm to human health, the breach of essential contractual obligations (cardinal obligations) or liability for other damage resulting from an intently or grossly negligent breach of duty on our part, our legal representatives or assistants. Cardinal obligations within the meaning of these Terms and Conditions are those obligations that make the due performance of this agreement and the achievement of its objectives possible in the first place, and on the regular compliance of which the user may therefore rely.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong> 9.2.2 </strong> &nbsp;  Where essential contractual obligations are violated, we will only be liable for the foreseeable damage typical to agreements of this nature if the damage were merely caused negligently, unless the damage claims by the user refer to cases of death or injury to body or health.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong> 9.2.3 </strong> &nbsp;  Claims in accordance with the German Product Liability Act will remain unaffected.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong> 9.2.4 </strong> &nbsp;  The restrictions of Sections 9.2.1 and 9.2.2 will also apply in favor of our legal representatives and assistants if claims are asserted against these parties directly.</p>

<h3><span class = "glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span> &nbsp; Miscellaneous: Final Provisions and Amendments to the Terms and Conditions of Use</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> 10.1 </strong> &nbsp;  This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong> 10.2 </strong> &nbsp;  If you have no place of jurisdiction in Germany or in any other EU member state, if you have transferred your permanent domicile abroad after these Terms of Use take effect or if your domicile or usual place of residence is unknown at the time legal action is taken, the sole place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this agreement will be the location of our registered offices.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong> 10.3 </strong> &nbsp;  Should individual provisions of these Terms of Use be or become invalid and/or contrary to the statutory provisions, this will not affect the validity remaining Terms of Use. In place of the invalid, unenforceable term, the Parties shall mutually agree on such valid commercial terms which the Parties would reasonably have agreed otherwise. The above-mentioned provision will apply correspondingly in the case of omissions in these provisions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong> 10.4 </strong> &nbsp;  We reserve the right to amend and adapt these Terms and Conditions with effect for the future. You can request the currently applicable version of the Terms of Use via <a href="mailto:contact@lifewin.com" data-track="Mailto:Support Contact:Terms Of Use">contact@lifewin.com</a> or access them at <a href="http://www.lifewin.co/terms.html">www.lifewin.co/terms-of-use</a>. You will be notified by email no later than one month before new Terms and Confitions take effect. If you do not object to the validity of the new Terms of Use within one month after they take effect, you will be deemed to have accepted the new Terms of Use. We will inform you separately in suitable form about the significance of the one month&#39;s notice period, your right to object and the legal consequences of non-objection. This amendment mechanism does not apply to amendments to the parties&#39; main contractual obligations.</p>
